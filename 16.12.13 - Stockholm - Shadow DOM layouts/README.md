## Abstract

I hope most of you are already familliar with our cool mapping ideas.
Now, I would like to tell you more about blending - that's the term we use for
mixing and aligning Apps' UI elements together within the same browsers window.


Some of you may know what it gives, some of you may not.
Some of you have already used it, some of you may not even be aware that it's there.
That's why I would like to make sure we all are more-or-less on the same page.
We'll all know what benefits it gives, how it works and how to use it to get the best results.

Also I'd like to show you that our solution will not only let you participate in
entire echosystem of apps and integrate seamlessly, but also that it
makes development and maintainance of your own apps easier, cleaner and even more modular.

Entire blending applies as well to entire page as as for functional section of pages - which we call "partials".
So, you can nest blending features as deep as you want.
