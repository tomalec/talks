> 2016.03.18 [meet.js Summit 16](http://summit.meetjs.pl/2016/)

## Abstract

CSS Grid Layout is the latest W3C spec for, well.. grid layouts.

Finally, it will work on Web Platform level. No more fancy CSS grid frameworks, no more clear fixes, floats, tables and other mess - the CSS as it should be.
You will see how to create almost any page layout with few lines of clear CSS, without div-soup, and without single byte of library or tool to download. You will learn how to code with ease, and get experience with tomorrow's tech.
